## Inspiration

Project for my first ever Hackathon (SacHack 2020). The prompt was given by MLH. 

## What it does

Supposedly, the program is a web app that takes in two preformatted Excel files containing players stats of the video games NBA 2k20 and analyze the data. Then, the backend would do some data science and outputs some interesting facts about the data as well as finding the most proficient players accross all teams. 

## How we built it

We use (vanilla) Java to design the back-end code, which was then redesigned into JavaScript code. The front-end consisted of HTML, CSS, and Node.js

## Challenge we ran into

We did not spend enough time with planning, which resulted in not having enough time to complete or test the web app. Granted, our team of four had to deal with a large learning curve with data science and front-end development. In addition, we never had proper training of the software engineering process, which resulted in the project lacking a lot of deliverable components. 

## What we learned

Yerba Mate is the best thing ever. RIP HoopStats, we went to find knowledge but found Yerba Mate near an airport. Also, should have used Python for the back-end (further back than the JavaScript layer) but oh well what can you do.
