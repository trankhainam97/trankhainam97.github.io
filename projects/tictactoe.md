## Inspiration

Submission for MLH's Local Hack Day. The idea was given as a challenge for "Creating a Game Simulator." 

## What it does

A generic game of tic-tac-toe played in the console command with additional features such as a menu and some quirky texts. 

## How we built it

I coded in Java using Eclipse IDE. I learned how to make the game from an MLH coach's Twitch liveshow instruction.

## Challenge we ran into

I was thinking hard on how to make such a simple project into something bigger than needed. I ended up successfully doing so but not to the full extend of my plan.

## What we learned

I had a good practice with Data Structures such as Array List, the concept of Inheritance, Software Engineering principles and practices.
